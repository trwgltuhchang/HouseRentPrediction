# HouseRentPrediction
## ðŸ“ˆ Forecasting Metro Housing Rents with LSTM

Built a deep learning model to forecast rent prices using time-series housing data, achieving strong predictive performance and interactive visualization.
* Data source: [House Rent Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Developed an LSTM model using **Keras** to forecast metro housing prices; achieved **MAE < 3.5%** and high RÂ² on validation set.
- Engineered features and constructed ETL pipelines to transform raw rental market data into structured sequences.
- Created a real-time rent prediction dashboard using **Plotly**, enabling interactive exploration of forecasts by region.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Deep Learning: Keras, LSTM
- Visualization: Plotly, Seaborn

## ðŸš€ Impact
- Demonstrated end-to-end deep learning lifecycle: from preprocessing to production-ready visual insight.
- Provided a scalable framework for integrating external APIs (e.g., Zillow) into predictive pricing tools.
